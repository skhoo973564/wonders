    <p>this is where i add <strong>dumb facts</strong> about random stuff, but you never know<br>
      it could be useful? That is, unless you really need those facts, but not a fact of a day<br>
      person so i will kinda suck at it, but thats ok, because no one cares.</P>

  <p>this game is short and you only have 1 good ending and 2 bad endings, i'll probably not update<br>
    it since my respo thing is going to have 100 of them, so yeah. You play at least you have a fun 30<br>
    second to 1 minute of your life wasted.</p><br>
