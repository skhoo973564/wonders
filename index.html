    <p>hi my name is <strong>samson</strong> and i like to code stuff even though i<br>
  suck at it, (im good at HTML) this main page has buttons and each<br>
      button will teleport you into a <strong>website</strong> i made... enjoy!</p>  
    
    
  
   <a href='https://skhoo973564.github.io/'><button>free dumb facts i did</button></a><br><br>
    <p>this is where i add <strong>dumb facts</strong> about random stuff, but you never know<br>
      it could be useful? That is, unless you really need those facts, but not a fact of a day<br>
      person so i will kinda suck at it, but thats ok, because no one cares.</P>
    
   <a href='https://skhoo973564.github.io/MyOfficialWebsite/'><button>about me</button></a>
      <p>all about me, but in a epic cool way... oh yeah and i have socials in discord just<br>
        saying. It also is my very first website i <strong>made</strong> so get really to feel nostalgic!<br>
  just kidding. if you think that website is dumb don't worry, there is more selections coming<br>
  soon.</p>
  
  <a href='https://skhoo973564.github.io/button_presser/'><button>bruh button</button></a><br>
  <p>nothing about it special, just a button which says bruh and thats it, oh yeah and<br>
    i don't know how to code it in the middle, since it's hard for me. credit to plebus<br>
    and tduck for helping me do this thing.</p>
